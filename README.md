# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where styles fail to apply due to misconfiguration of the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Problem
The primary cause is often an incorrect or incomplete `content` array within your Tailwind configuration file. This array defines the files Tailwind should scan for classes. If your component files are not included or the paths are incorrect, Tailwind won't find and apply your styles.

## Solution
The solution is usually to update the `content` array to include all files that contain Tailwind classes.  Always double check the paths are correct relative to your `tailwind.config.js` file.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Observe the lack of Tailwind styles in the initial state.
4. Follow the instructions in `bugSolution.js` to correct the configuration. 
5. Re-run your build process to see the styles applied.
